# Coffee Vending Machine #

IDeaS just contracted you to design and build a set of coffee machines for their workplace. There are mechanical
designers taking care of all the mechanical parts of the machines. You are responsible for the machine's controlling
software.

IDeaSâ€™ requirements are very simple. They want to sell coffee, with or without cream powder and sugar, for $0.35. The
front panel will have 4 buttons, for Black, Cream, Sugar and Cream & Sugar. There will also be a Coin Return button. The
machine will take (American) coins only, and give change.

Any other displays are up to you to decide on and design. There will be dispensers that can dispense a fixed amount of
cup, hot water, coffee powder, cream powder, sugar.

### The basic operations that are included in the solution

* Accept coffee selection
* Provide coffee
